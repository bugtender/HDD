# Humor Driven Development

> I believe Happy will make developer more productive.


## Why we need HDD

If you are a software developer. You must know about TDD, Test-Driven
Development. That's will help you build a safe and bugless project.

Now the project is bugless, but the developer are not. So we need to make
ourself more "healthy".

## What is HDD

HDD is a attitude. You can use it everywhere you want.

## How to HDD

#### When you are developing

Moving you seat far away from the PM or Boss, as far as you can.

By the way. Having your favorite drink on your desk is more helpful.

#### Writing test case

Please don't use "foo" or "bar". Using other words!

#### Naming variable or function

Don't use p1, v1, v2 as variable. Please make it more friendly.

#### Naming everything you will use in developing

For example.  "Gandalf" for CI system, "Houston" for your manager, "C4" for your computer.

#### When CI build success

High five with colleague next to you.

#### When CI build failed

Gandalf: "You should not PASS !!"

#### When you reviewing PR and it's good

Give it a emoji and say "well done."

#### When you reviewing PR and it's bad

Please don't just leave "WTF" and close it.

You can use emoji to show your feeling (like :trollface ) and say "Nice job" but
still close it.

#### When pair programming

Forcing your colleague who use sublimeText to pair with you by vim.

#### When releasing the major version but you find a bug.

"Houston, we have a problem."

#### When you hate someone in your office

Just help them update to windows 10.



## One more thing ...
