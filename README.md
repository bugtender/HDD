# Humor Driven Development

> I believe Happy will make developer more productive.


## Why we need HDD

If you are a software developer. You must know about TDD, Test-Driven
Development. That's will help you build a safe and bugless project. 
Now the project is bugless, but the developer are not. So we need to make
ourself more "healthy".

## What is HDD

HDD is a attitude. You can use it everywhere you want.

## How to HDD

#### When you are developing

Moving you seat far away from the PM or Boss, as far as you can.

#### Writing test case

Please don't use "foo" or "bar". Using other words!

#### Naming everything you will use in developing

For example.  "Gandalf" for CI system, "Houston" for your manager.

#### When CI build success

High five the colleague next to you.

#### When CI build failed

Gandalf: You should not PASS !!

#### When Review PR

If you think that code is not good. Please don't just leave "WTF" and close it.
you can use emoji to show your feeling (like :trollface ) and say "Nice job" but
still close it.

#### When pair programming

Forcing your colleague who use sublimeText to pair with you by vim.

#### When releasing the major version but you find a bug.

"Houston, we have a problem."
